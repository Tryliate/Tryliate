# 🚀 Tryliate: The Native MCP Orchestrator

## 📌 The Vision: Connectivity as the new Code

Tryliate is a "fresh" approach to the Agentic Age. We are moving beyond building isolated AI tools and instead focusing on **Universal Connectivity**.

**Tryliate is the "Switchboard" for the AI Economy.**

Instead of proprietary SDKs or complex integration code, Tryliate leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to allow any server (database, API, tool) to connect with any agent (Claude, custom bots) instantly.

### 🔗 The "Connect & Orchestrate" Philosophy
- **MCP-to-MCP Connect**: Drag and drop independent servers and connect them into seamless workflows.
- **AI-Powered Data Mapping**: Using advanced LLMs to automatically map data schemas between tools.
- **Universal Reach**: Secure orchestration for both B2B and B2C tools.

## 🎯 Implementation Goals

1.  **The Multi-Server Registry**: Connect and host multiple MCP transports.
2.  **Smart Mapping Engine**: Translate outputs from one MCP server to inputs of another.
3.  **Workflow Orchestrator**: Run visual diagrams as autonomous background agents.
4.  **Tryliate Cloud**: A global registry for community-built "Connectors."

*Tryliate is the engine of the AI-machine economy. We are building the protocols that make the future autonomous.*
