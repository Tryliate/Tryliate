```

## Troubleshooting

### Large Codebase Performance
For very large codebases that take significant time to analyze:
- You SHOULD provide progress updates during analysis
- You SHOULD suggest focusing on specific directories or components if performance becomes an issue
- Consider running with consolidate=false to generate individual files faster

### Update Mode Issues
If update mode fails to detect changes correctly:
- Check if git history is available and accessible
- Try running with update_mode=false to generate fresh documentation

### Consolidation Issues
If consolidation fails or produces poor results:
- Check that consolidate_prompt provides clear guidance for the target file type
- Verify that all source documentation files were generated successfully
- Consider using a more specific consolidate_prompt for better results

### Missing Documentation Sections
If certain aspects of the codebase are not well documented:
- Check the review_notes.md file for identified gaps
- Consider running with check_completeness=true to identify missing areas
- Review the codebase analysis to ensure all components were properly identified

### Git Integration Problems
If git commands fail during update mode:
- Ensure the codebase_path is within a valid git repository
- Check that git is installed and accessible
- Verify that the user has appropriate permissions to read git history
